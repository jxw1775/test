<p><span class =""> The GOP’s website </span>introduces Donald Trump’s nominee for Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, as a financial expert with experience backing films with heroic themes such as “X-Men.” 

Nowhere does it mention that he’s also the former CEO of OneWest, a bank that critics allege acted more like a movie villain by locking out one homeowner during a blizzard and foreclosing on a 90-year-old woman who sent a check that was short by 27 cents. 

But OneWest may become better known to Americans as Mnuchin nears his confirmation hearing to run the Treasury, which has duties including oversight of the country’s national banks and enforcing federal finance laws. Critics of Mr. Trump’s Treasury appointee were handed additional ammunition on Tuesday with a leaked memo from the California attorney general’s office, which found evidence of “widespread misconduct” at Mnuchin’s bank. </span></p>
